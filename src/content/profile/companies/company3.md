### Tech Mahindra (2016-2017)

I spearheaded the development of intricate mobile application projects, leading
the architectural design, devising testing strategies, conducting unit tests,
and troubleshooting. Notably, I created and released "mReceipts" and "mFinance"
mobile apps for Oracle EBS, ensuring availability on both Android and iOS
platforms. Furthermore, I conducted demonstration sessions for current and
prospective clients, presenting our mobile solutions and offering
recommendations to enhance and future-proof their existing software systems.
