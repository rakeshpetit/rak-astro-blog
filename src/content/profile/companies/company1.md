### Oracle (2009-2015)

As a member of the development team, I contributed to the creation of Contract
Lifecycle Management (CLM) software tailored for US Federal government. My
responsibilities included drafting Technical Design Documents, Software
development, facilitating Development to Quality Assurance transitions, and
conducting "Learning sessions for Oracle Support" to troubleshoot problems.
Additionally, I took charge of Build & Release Management engineering for
specific Oracle E-Business Suite modules, overseeing development, compilation,
versioning, installation, configuration, and upgrades. Through extensive client
interactions, I provided strategic technical support, with a focus on leveraging
automated technology to diagnose, document, and resolve or prevent issues.
