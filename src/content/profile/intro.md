With over a decade of experience in software development, I specialize in React
Native, crafting impactful applications for iOS and Android platforms.
Transitioning from server-side to mobile development in 2015, I have contributed
to projects ranging from order-ahead experiences for major fast-food brands to
creating mobile ERP, banking, consumer, and lifestyle apps.
